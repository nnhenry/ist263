        Hi! My name is Noah Henry. I am a 4th year Industrial and Interaction Design student interested in product design and user experience. My design skills include Adobe Creative Cloud, Solidworks, Keyshot, Figma, model making, and user research. Outside of school, I share my passion of weightlifting through Instagram and I participate in a variety of action sports including snowboarding, skiing, skateboarding, scootering, and BMX.
